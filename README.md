# ForgeModdingTips
Some general tips and tricks to help with Minecraft Forge modding in 1.8.9.

## Before you start
[Repository by TymanWasTaken with helpful information on setting up a modding workspace and coding a mod](https://github.com/TymanWasTaken/ForgeModdingResources) <br>

A good understanding of Java is recommended if you want to start coding mods.

## Workspace Tips
> I use IntelliJ IDEA so all tips will be for IntelliJ.

### Plugins
After setting up your workspace ([guide](https://github.com/TymanWasTaken/ForgeModdingResources/blob/master/mytutorials/setting-up.md)), you can install some plugins.

Plugins can help with auto-completing code or hot-swapping code.

[Minecraft Development](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development) <br>
Useful for providing auto-completions to code, suggesting code and more.

[HotswapAgent](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9552-hotswapagent) <br>
Helps to hot-swap code ([Setup Guide Here](https://github.com/ENORMOUZ/ForgeModdingTips/blob/master/mytutorials/hotswapguide.md))

## Mixins
Mixins can be useful as you can either overwrite some parts of Minecraft's code (sort of), or inject your own code to be ran. ([Setup Guide Here](https://github.com/ENORMOUZ/ForgeModdingTips/blob/master/mytutorials/mixins.md))
